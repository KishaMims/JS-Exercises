// Week 3 - Functions

// In the following exercises, you will need to place your code or answer underneath each
// exercise prompt.

// First try answering these without using references or looking up any information.
// Then, check your answer by using references and/or running your code.
// You can run your JS code using the Chrome or Firefox Developer tools, or by using Node.js.
// Feel free to update your answers if you got them wrong at first -- this exercise is for your own learning.
// But make sure you understand why the correct answer is right.

// Exercise 1. Define a function called logGreeting() that prints the string “Hello!” (use console.log).
// Underneath the function, write the line of code that runs the function.

function logGreeting(){
  console.log("Hello!");
}

logGreeting();

// Exercise 2. Define a function called getName() that *returns* a string that is your name.
// Remember, this function should return the string -- not print it.
// Then print your name in the console by passing getName() into the console.log() function.

function getName() {
  return ("NeKisha Mims")
}

console.log(getName());


// Exercise 3. Call a function within a function -- Write a function called logGreeting2()
// that prints a full sentence that contains your name: "Hello! My name is <name>."
// logGreeting2 should call myName() to get your name.
// Then print your greeting to the console by calling logGreeting2().

function logGreeting2() {
 return ("Hello! My name is " + myName() +".");

function myName() {
  return "NeKisha Mims";
 }
}

console.(logGreeting2());


// Exercise 4. Write a function that takes 3 parameters that are all numbers.
// The function should return the sum of the 3 numbers.
// Then write some function calls you would use to test your function.

function excerciseFour(num1, num2, num3){
   return num1 + num2 + num3;
}

console.log(excerciseFour(4,5,6));
console.log(excerciseFour(10,10,10));
console.log(excerciseFour(200,300,400));


// Exercise 5. Let's say a museum gives a discount for children ages 14 or under, and seniors 65 or older.
// Write a function that takes in a person's age and returns true if they should get a discount.
// Otherwise it should return false.
// Then write some function calls you would use to test your function.

function exerciseFive(age){
  if (age <= 14 || age >= 65) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}

console.log(exerciseFive(14));
console.log(exerciseFive(3));
console.log(exerciseFive(45));
console.log(exerciseFive(65));
console.log(exerciseFive(70));
console.log(exerciseFive(20));


// Exercise 6. Write a function that takes 2 parameters -- one number and one string.
// The function should print the string the given number of times.
// Then write some function calls you would use to test your function.

function exerciseSix(number,string){
//  return string.repeat(number);
  for (let i = 0; i < number; i++) {
      console.log(string);
   }
}
console.log(exerciseSix(8,"here we go "));


// Exercise 7. Read the following code (don't run it yet)
function mysteryFunction1(p1) {
  return p1 * 2;
}
const y = 4;
const z = mysteryFunction1(y);
console.log("The value of y is " + y);
console.log("The value of z is " + z);

// Without running the code, write down in a comment:
// 1. What mysteryFunction1 does

// This is the name of the function to be called. 

// 2. What prints out for the value of y

// eight?

// 3. What prints out for the value of z

// four?

// Now run the code and see if you're correct.


// Were you correct? If not, what did you learn?

// I was not correct I got the numbers mixed up between the two. I see now that y is defined as four so it is always going to be four for the value.


// Exercise 8. Read the following code (don't run it yet)
function mysteryFunction2(p1, p2) {
  const x = p1 - p2;
  return x;
}
const a = mysteryFunction2(10, 4);
const b = mysteryFunction2(a, 1);
console.log("The value of a is " + a);
console.log("The value of b is " + b);

// Without running the code, write down in a comment:
// 1. What mysteryFunction2 does
// it is the function name and it passes to parameters through.

// 2. What prints out for the value of a

// 6

// 3. What prints out for the value of b

// 5

// Now run the code and see if you're correct.

// Were you correct? If not, what did you learn?
// Yes I was correct for this one. I learned here about variable definitions and them being const so they cannot change. 


 //Exercise 9. This exercise is to practice reading the documentation for functions.
// String.split() is a function in the JavaScript standard library that you can use in your code.
// Read about the split() function here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split
// Try to use it to solve the following challenges:


// Here's a string I made representing my grocery list.
// Using split() and groceryList, make an array of my grocery list items
const groceryList = "eggs,carrots,orange juice";

const groceryListCopy= groceryList.split(",");
console.log(groceryListCopy);


// Here's a string I made representing my morning schedule.
// Using split() and mySchedule, make an array of the *first 2* things I do in the morning
// There are multiple ways to do this, but try doing it using only the split() function.

const mySchedule = "wake up--->brush teeth--->eat breakfast--->go to work";

console.log(mySchedule.split("--->",2));


// Congrats, you made it to the end!
// Did you find this easy or hard? If you used references, which ones helped you?
// Please answer in a comment below.
//I used MDN docs, I also went to the study session to help undestand the split functions. I also went back to freecodecamp to reviewe split lessons.
