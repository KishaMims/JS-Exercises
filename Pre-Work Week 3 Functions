// Week 3 - Functions

// In the following exercises, you will need to place your code or answer underneath each
// exercise prompt.

// First try answering these without using references or looking up any information.
// Then, check your answer by using references and/or running your code.
// You can run your JS code using the Chrome or Firefox Developer tools, or by using Node.js.
// Feel free to update your answers if you got them wrong at first -- this exercise is for your own learning.
// But make sure you understand why the correct answer is right.

// Exercise 1. Define a function called logGreeting() that prints the string “Hello!” (use console.log).
// Underneath the function, write the line of code that runs the function.

function logGreeting(){
  console.log("Hello!");
}

logGreeting();

// Exercise 2. Define a function called getName() that *returns* a string that is your name.
// Remember, this function should return the string -- not print it.
// Then print your name in the console by passing getName() into the console.log() function.

function getName() {
  return ("NeKisha Mims")
}

console.log(getName());


// Exercise 3. Call a function within a function -- Write a function called logGreeting2()
// that prints a full sentence that contains your name: "Hello! My name is <name>."
// logGreeting2 should call myName() to get your name.
// Then print your greeting to the console by calling logGreeting2().

function logGreeting2() {
 return ("Hello! My name is " + myName() +".");

function myName() {
  return "NeKisha Mims";
 }
}

(logGreeting2());


// Exercise 4. Write a function that takes 3 parameters that are all numbers.
// The function should return the sum of the 3 numbers.
// Then write some function calls you would use to test your function.

function excerciseFour(num1, num2, num3){
   return num1 + num2 + num3;
}

console.log(excerciseFour(4,5,6));
console.log(excerciseFour(10,10,10));
console.log(excerciseFour(200,300,400));


// Exercise 5. Let's say a museum gives a discount for children ages 14 or under, and seniors 65 or older.
// Write a function that takes in a person's age and returns true if they should get a discount.
// Otherwise it should return false.
// Then write some function calls you would use to test your function.

function exerciseFive(age){
  if (age <= 14 || age >= 65) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}

console.log(exerciseFive(14));
console.log(exerciseFive(3));
console.log(exerciseFive(45));
console.log(exerciseFive(65));
console.log(exerciseFive(70));
console.log(exerciseFive(20));


// Exercise 6. Write a function that takes 2 parameters -- one number and one string.
// The function should print the string the given number of times.
// Then write some function calls you would use to test your function.

function exerciseSix(number,string){
  return string.repeat(number);
  }
console.log(exerciseSix(8,"here we go "));
console.log(exerciseSix(6,"answer six "));
console.log(exerciseSix(12,"is this right? "));
