// Week 3 - Arrays and Objects

// In the following exercises, you will need to place your code or answer underneath each
// exercise prompt.

// First try answering these without using references or looking up any information.
// Then, check your answer by using references and/or running your code.
// You can run your JS code using the Chrome or Firefox Developer tools, or by using Node.js.
// Feel free to update your answers if you got them wrong at first -- this exercise is for your own learning.
// But make sure you understand why the correct answer is right.

// Exercise 1. Make an empty array named animals

var animals =[];

// Exercise 2. Add the string "frog" to the array

animals = ["frog"];


// Exercise 3. Add 4 more animals of your choice to the array. Try to add all of them in one line of code.


animals.push("donkey","zebra","bear","monkey");

console.log(animals);

// Exercise 4. Update the first item in the array to be "gorilla"

animals.splice(0,1,"gorilla");

console.log(animals);

// Exercise 5. Print the number of items in the array (use the array property that will give you this information)


console.log(animals.length);


// Exercise 6. Print the first item in the array

console.log(animals[0]);


// Exercise 7. Print the last item in the array (as part of your answer, use the same array property you used in exercise 5 above)

console.log(animals[4]);


// Exercise 8. Remove the last item from the array

console.log(animals.pop());
console.log(animals);


// Exercise 9. Now make a new array named assortedThings that contains at least 3 strings and 3 numbers.

var assortedThings = ["pizza",45,"party",31,"zoom",31];

console.log(assortedThings); 

// Exercise 10. Write a for loop that iterates through the assortedThings array and prints each index and item, such as:
// Item #0 is potato
// Item #1 is 4
// Item #2 is Hello World
// ...
var assortedThings = ["pizza",45,"party",31,"zoom",31];

for(let i = 0; i <assortedThings.length; i++){
    console.log(`Item # ${i} is ${assortedThings[i]}`); 
}


// Exercise 11. Write a function that takes an array of numbers as a parameter. For each number in the array,
// print the number and "BIG" if it's over 100, "small" if it's between 0 and 100, and "negative" if
// it's less than 0. Example:
// if the array is [-2, 200, 50], print:
// -2 negative
// 200 BIG
// 50 small
//
// Then write some function calls you would use to test your function.

function excerciseEleven(numbers){
  for(let c= 0; c < numbers.length; c++) {
    var value = numbers[c];
    if (value > 100) {
      console.log(value + " BIG") 
    } else if (value >= 0 && value <= 100) {
      console.log(value + " small")
    } else {
      console.log(value + " negative")
    }
}
}

var numbers = [45, 34, 101, 100, -45, 0];
console.log(excerciseEleven(numbers));


// Exercise 12. Make an object called me that contains the following keys: name, favoriteAnimal, favoriteNumber
// The values of those keys can be whatever you choose.

let me = {
  name: 'NeKisha',
  favoriteAnimal:'dogs',
  favoriteNumber: '88'
};

console.log(me);

// Exercise 13. Add another 2 keys and values to the object (you choose what they are)

me["age"] = 31;
me["favoriteFood"] = 'seafood';

console.log(me);

// Exercise 14. Update the favoriteAnimal value to something different

me.favoriteAnimal = 'elephants';

console.log(me);

// Exercise 15. Print the value of favoriteAnimal.
// Note: there are at least 2 ways to get the value of a key, try to write both.

console.log(me["favoriteAnimal"]);
console.log(me.favoriteAnimal);

// Congrats, you made it to the end!
// Did you find this easy or hard? 
// Please answer in a comment below.
//If you used references, which ones helped you? Problem 11 was difficult for me and 10. I did use stackoverflow to find assitance with the string formation.
I also got help with quesyion 11 from the study session as I was confused on it there was a different way to pass an array as a parameter.
